Chapter 4.:
The files are released into the internet for anyone to read, people are quick to
analyse through every single tiny detail, some immediate details come to light:
- Slyvasta was researching ethically questionable areas of science, in
  particular, they were running hundreds of tests daily on a variety of beastman
  test subjects. But nobody could prove anyone was there against their will.
- However, the research did also get immediately picked up by foreign powers who
  quickly discovered that the beastman society living in the city is a far
  greater threat than they initially anticipated.
- The city, with Sylvasta's public advice, immediately ordered evacuation of all
  citizens to any area they could find fearing a potentially deadly conflict on
  the horizon. The city quickly came under fire over the coming days.
