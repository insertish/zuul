You're about to be placed into the world.
If at any point you are stuck with what to do,
you can use `help` to view all available commands.

You wake up to the sound of people chanting outside..
You really should've closed the window last night..

Curious, you peer out the window to see what's going on.. there's a group of
protestors outside the Medical Centre down the street, you can't really make out
what they're saying or what their signs say.

Though it'd not be surprising if something strange is going on in there, but you
can't really put your finger on it. Maybe there's something on the news..
